    Georgia, a country at the intersection of Europe and Asia, is a former
    Soviet republic thatâ€™s home to Caucasus Mountain villages and Black Sea
    beaches. In the southeast, it has a border with Azerbaijan, in the south
    with Armenia and Turkey, and in the north with Russia. Georgia is physically
    connected to the European Union.

      Must see places to visit:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Tbilisi (The capital of the country of Georgia. Its cobblestoned old
          town reflects a long, complicated history, with periods under Persian
          and Russian rule. Its diverse architecture encompasses Eastern
          Orthodox churches, ornate art <stromg> nouveau</stromg> buildings and Soviet Modernist
          structures.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tusheti (A historic region in northeast Georgia. A mountainous area,
          it is home to the Tusheti National Park. By the conventional
          definition of the Europe-Asia boundary as following the watershed of
          the Greater Caucasus, Tusheti is geographically a European part of
          Georgia.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Svaleti (A historical region in northwest Georgia, bordering Russia.
          Sitting in the southern Greater Caucasus mountain range, it's
          characterized by snowcapped peaks and deep gorges. The medieval
          villages of Upper Svaneti are dotted with koshki, defensive stone
          structures built from the 9th century onwards.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Batumi (A Black Sea resort and port city, is the capital of the
          Georgian republic of Adjara. Batumi Boulevard encompasses a waterfront
          promenade with a park and beach. The 130m-high Alphabetic Tower,
          adorned with Georgian script, has a seaside observation deck.)
